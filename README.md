# C - Sorting algorithms and Big O
Hi! On this folder you'll find some C programs that performs the sorting of a number's sequence, represented on an array or a doubly linked list. Each C file name tells you which sorting algorithm is used, and the O files contain the Big O notation for the best case, the average case, and the worst case for each algorithm.
